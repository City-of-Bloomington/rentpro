<h2>Introduction</h2>
<!--           ----->
<p>
This system is intended to facilitate the registration of rental properties in Bloomington and issue permits for property owners. It provide the means to track the registration process, inspection, billing and other related activities. 
This system will provide the search engine and issue reports to measure performance. This system is desinged for the HAND department. 
<p>
This manual will give users an introduction to the Rental Processing System (RentPro).  The system is written in Java Servlets. A web based user interface with Oracle Database as backend data store. It can be run on any computer with network connection and a web browser such as Netscape and MS Internet Explorer.  The application objective was the ease of use and web enabled so that the HAND employee will be able to use it from his/her desktop without any specific installations on his/her computer.
<p>
This application came as a replacement for the old rental application that has been used in the City for a number of years.  The two application can co-exist together even though the new one has more features built, new data fields, new reports and an extensive search engine. 
<p>
This course will walk you through this program by simple steps with snap shots of the real interface forms with the explanations of different options and what to expect.  

<a name=run>
<h2>Running RentPro </h2>
<!--              ----->
<p>
Only authorized HAND employees will be able to run this program.
Some of the Employees will have more privileges to update and/or delete records. These employees will have different levels of privileges as will be explained in the section 'Privileges'. To access this system the user need to start his favorite browser (such as Netscape) and type 'http://rentpro' in the URL location. The user will  be introduced to the RentPro welcome page as the one shown below.

<p>
When the user clicks on the link 'here' in the welcome page the user will be presented with the Login form where the user has to use his own username and password. These are the same username and password the user would use to access his email. The Login form is shown in Fig. 2.

<nl>
<li> New Permit.
<li> New Owner.
<li> Simple Search.
<li> Extensive Search.
<li> Owners Search.
<li> Check Address.
<li> Reports.
<li> Statistics Reports.
<li> Help (this document).
<li> Logout from the System.
</nl>
<p>
 Probably other options will be added as needed in the future. Some options may not be availbable for every user, depending on the privilege level associated with that user. 

<a name=add>
<h2> Add a New Permit or Registration </h2>
<!--                   ---->

<tr><td><b>Fig. 4</b> Add a New Registration
</td></tr></table>
</center>

<p>
All the basic information are in the top part, such as the address and the owner information. The lower part of the form is mainly devoted for notes and processing (see Fig. 5). 
<p>
In this form, even though it is desirable to fill in as much information as possible the user is required to fill in at least the address information such as street name and number. This is because it is not always possible to get all the information right away, but probably can be added later as it becomes available through the inspection operations.    
<p>
Some of the fields in this form are drop down lists, so the user can select directly, other fields are text field where the user will type in. For the date fields the "today" check boxes are provided to simplify the data entry. 
</P>

<p>
When all the information is entered the user should always click on the 'Create' button to create the new record and save it in the database.  
 </P>

<p>
After clicking on the Create button the user will be presented with the same form again with some additional buttons for further processing. A small message will appeare on the top of the page to show that the registration has been saved (in green) or an error message (in red) if a problem occurred. So watch for these messages carefully and proceed accordingly.  The additional items in the form are shown in Fig. 5.</p>

To edit the address click on the "edit address" link next the address. The address editor window will open so that the address can be changed.
</P>


<a name=search>
<h2>Simple and Extensive Search for Permits</h2>
<p> 
The idea behind two different kind of searches is due to the fact that the registration system is based on a number of tables in the database. The main table is the registration table. In addition there are the owner table, address table, zoning table, .. .etc. The simple search is devoted to search mainly in the registration table only where address or owner information are not required in the search process. While the extensive search is intended to be used for complicated queries when the address or owner info for examople are important part of the search. Since the extensive search is based on the projection of multiple tables, some records coould be repeated. For example a permit with two owners could show as two records one for each owner. Similary for two addresses. In simple search each record will show up only once. 
<p>
Which search to use? To answer this question consider the following;
<li> if looking for a record with a known id then use the simple search. 
<li> if looking for records between two periods, use simple search too.
<li> if looking permits associated with certain owner, agent, address, zone or any inputs that are not available in simple search then use the extensive search.
<li> As a rule of thumb use simple search first, if you think this form will not give you the necessary fields to make your query then use the extensive search.
<li> Simple search will work faster as the query is simpler.
<li> You may get results in simple search that you may not get in extensive search.
<p> In the search forms most of the text fields are case insensitive. The option of full match, start with, ends with or contains is also provided to increase the possibilities of matching operations. Such as street name, owner name, owner address and notes fields all carry this feature.
</P>
<p> <font color=red>Caution </font> Try not to use the search engine without any entries. If for any reason the "Browse" button without filling any field, this means the user is asking for all the records in the system. Since these count in a number of thousands, this may take long time to get the result or you may get partial results and the possibility of the browser being hang. In this case try to close your browser and restart again and try to avoid this situation in the futur. To overcome this problem, the user is adviced to enter a reasonble range of dates that cover no more than one year at a time such as 01/01/2000 to 01/01/2001 and so on. Fig. 15 is the simple search interface.

<a name=addr>
<h2>Check Address</h2>
<p>
A search engine for addresses. Has two main goals. To verify that certain address exists in the GIS master address. Second to check if certain address is already used in the rental system. If the rental system is used the corresponding permit ids will be listed in the matching table where the user can jump to the corresponding permit.
<p>Search for street name is case insensitive and could be partial match whern used with the options of "start with", "ends with", or "contains" otherwise it is a complete match with "is" option.
<p>When searching for an address use as little information as possible, such as street name. To narrow your search you can fill other fields such as street number and direction. See Fig. 16 for more details.

    "Property managed by Owner" or Properties managed by agent".
